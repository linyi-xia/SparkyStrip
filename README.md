# SparkyStrip
The project aims to develop a load disaggregation device. This device can detect the plug load appliances of which the current flows thru the SparkyStrip. The devices uses an Analog Device power metering chip. The PCB then communicates to the Arduino Due to collect 7 characterristic mesurements, derived from 57 samples per cycle on a 60Hz residential line. 

More information coming later.
